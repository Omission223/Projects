# Projects

### Disclaimer:

These images showcase a collection of projects and activities I've undertaken over the past few years. Due to the volume of images, I recommend scrolling through them quickly to save time. While I'll provide explanations for some of the pictures, I may not cover them all. However, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to askâ€”I'm more than happy to provide detailed explanations for each image. Additionally, if desired, I can provide more pictures beyond the ones uploaded, since this is just a small part of the collection of images that I have.

:warning: Unfortunately, I'm unable to provide screenshots of conversations with clients, manufacturers, sellers, etc., out of respect for privacy and confidentiality. I hope for your understanding in this matter. The same applies to any projects or work containing sensitive information.

:warning: These pictures were originally intended for my personal use only. Some were taken for reference or to share with friends, and I never anticipated using them as proof of my work. If I had known, I would have taken more or better pictures specifically for demonstration purposes. Unfortunately, these images are the only proof I have in many cases, which is why I'm sharing them now.

:warning: I kindly request that you respect my privacy. These pictures are intended for viewing by individuals directly involved in the hiring process. Therefore, I ask that they not be downloaded, shared, or distributed in any way. After the hiring process is complete, this repository will be made private, and the link will no longer be accessible.
