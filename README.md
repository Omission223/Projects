## PC, Hardware, repair, testing, electronics and other stuff

### Some of the things I did the past month:

![screen](./img1/p1.jpg)

*Display broken after a drop, this display was already replaced with OEM part previously, however, since it is not economical to replace it with another OEM display, an aftermarket display was ordered instead, since it's cheaper.*

![phones](./img1/p2.jpg)

*Yes, those are all phones, I have a lot of them, this pile is just old stuff that is not worth or economical to repair, I have more of these than just this picture. I keep them just in case I'll ever need spare parts from them or just for practicing my skills.*

![back](./img1/p3.jpg)

*Back glass repair. Camera lens broken and needs replacement. Usually these types of repairs require heat to make the adhesive unstick easier. To do this professionally, you need a heat plate that has temperature control and vacuum suction, which is exactly what you can see here.*

![tools](./img1/p4_2.jpg)
![tools2](./img1/p7.jpg)

*Speaking of tools, you can see more of them here.*

![speakers1](./img1/p9.jpg)
![speakers2](./img1/p8.jpg)
![speakers3](./img1/p10.jpg)

*Speaker system repair. Had to diagnose the issue, since one of the speakers refused to work. It turns out the issue was with the wiring and old cracked solder joints. Had to make new wiring and resolder the potentiometer (volume knob).*

![bike1](./img1/p4.jpg)
![bike2](./img1/p5.jpg)
![bike3](./img1/p6.jpg)

*E-Bike repair. Controller and wiring issues. Had to order new parts. Still waiting for them to arrive, since I could not find necessary parts in Lithuania, so had to order replacement parts from abroad.*

### Older works:

*Home assistant with it's typical dashboard. It's Linux based OS specifically designed for home automation. You can see my dashboard here, although all the sensors are down, since I moved places recently, and all of my home automation stuff is back at the other house. You can see that virtualization is being used, since I use VirtualBox to run it, while also using Superputty to manage the access remotely to my various instances of operating systems.*

I think this is enough. Again, the main point of these images is to prove that I kept myself busy and worked on many things. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask, I will be more than happy to answer.
